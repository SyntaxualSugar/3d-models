# Tamper DeWiggler

This is a part that fits on the shaft of generic Aliexpress "self-leveling" espresso tampers. The problem is that the plastic fitting on the self-leveling plate is far too loose. With this part, you unscrew the plastic fitting, slide this into the leveling plate, and then tighten the plastic fitting down to afix the part. It should fit the shaft much tigher and improve the leveling.
